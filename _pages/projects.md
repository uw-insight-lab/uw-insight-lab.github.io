<h2 style="font-size:0.9em;"> Human-AI Collboration in Data Driven Descision Making </h2>
 <div style="font-size:0.7em;"> A crucial, time consuming, step in data-driven decision making is systemically analyzing data to uncover insights in the form of patterns, trends, outliers, and other anomalies (or lack thereof). This group of projects will investigate to what extent, and in what ways, AI agents can collborate with teams of data workers to discover and prioritize actionable insights for decision making.

<h2 style="font-size:0.9em;">  Human-Centered Evaluation of AI generated Code </h2>
<div style="font-size:0.7em;">
In collaborative team settings, individual data workers prioritize different factors when assessing insights, as do AI agents. Projects in this space will explore techniques that allows humans and AI agents to externalize and align priorities when assessing insight quality. These projects will also seek to modify AI agent behavior to better align with human priorities.

<h2 style="font-size:0.9em;"> Provenance in Human-AI Collboration </h2>
<div style="font-size:0.7em;">
As humans and AI agents work collborative, its becomes  important to understand how decisions are made, what factors influence them, and how both human and AI inputs contribute to the outcome. This group of projects will explore mechanisms for capturing, representing, and using provenance information.
