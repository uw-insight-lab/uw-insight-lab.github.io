There are [various ways](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/current-undergraduate-students/research-opportunities) to join the lab. Mostly likely, you will be paired with an ongoing project led by a gradudate student. In limited circumstances, you may be able to lead a project, but this depends on your skills, interests, and future research goals (e.g., if you want to pursue a gradudate degree in the future).
