PhD and Masters positions are fully funded. Students must apply by Dec. 1st <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/computer-science/future-graduate-students/applying-admissions" target="_blank"> through official channels </a> to be formally considered.

<h3 style="font-size:0.9em;"> Undergraduate students</h3>
<div style="font-size:0.7em;">
There are <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/current-undergraduate-students/research-opportunities" target="_blank">various ways</a> to join the lab.  Most likely, you will be paired with an ongoing project led by a graduate student. In limited circumstances, you may be able to lead a project, but this depends on your skills, interests, and future research goals (e.g., if you want to pursue a graduate degree in the future).
