Welcome to the Intelligent Systems for Guided, Human-Centered Technology (INSIGHT) Lab, at the [University of Waterloo's School of Computer Science](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/).

Our team is dedicated to advancing the next generation of intelligent systems that meaningfully empower and support people to make complex, data-driven decisions. We leverage techniques and methodologies from  Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Visualization (Vis), and Applied AI/ML to design, build, and evaluate intelligent systems that are attuned to human needs and objectives, while fostering transparency, trust, and efficiency.
